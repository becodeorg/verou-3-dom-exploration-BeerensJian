# Project Jian's Collection
In this exercise we had to gather data and use this data to dynamically display the contents on your page. I made mine about recent books I've read and some books that are funny or that I want to read in the future.


##Links to webpages
[Collection with framework](https://blissful-kirch-245f99.netlify.app/)
[Collection without framework](https://keen-banach-f8413f.netlify.app/)

##TODO
- Add a button when clicked it adds a random effect to the card elements
- Make a search Filter
